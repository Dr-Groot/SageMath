# Installation

For MacOS and Window go with [Download SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/download.html) to Download the Software, its open source so no trouble in downloading.

After **SageMath** is installed, see that you have **Jupyter Notebook** if not go with link to download [CLICK HERE](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

<br />

We will be using **Jupyter Notebook** as our primary workspace, So lets get Start now.

# SageMath for Graph Theory

For making a complete graph we use **graphs.CompleteGraph()** as in arguement we can give the number of vertices or nodes.

For Example:

Lets say we want to make a Complete Graph with 5 vertices then we will go with **graphs.CompleteGraph(5)** on our Jupyter Notebook.
